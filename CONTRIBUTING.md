# Contributing to DCSA
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features


## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github and all Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase and or documentation.
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!


## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-EBL-Envelope/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact DCSA if that's a concern.

## Code standard
We use [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), when using
IntelliJ it is recommended to download and activate the
[google-java-format plugin](https://github.com/google/google-java-format).

## DCSA Core packages
When using DCSA Core package we recommend following this [guide](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-Core/blob/master/README.md#how-to-use-dcsa-core-packages)

## Report bugs and raise feature requests using Github's [issues](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-EBL-Envelope/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-EBL-Envelope/issues/new); it's that easy!
For reporting a feature request use the label: **_enhancement_**

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and if possible a sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. With instructions how to run it to reproduce the bug
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
